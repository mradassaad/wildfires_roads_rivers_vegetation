# What constrains wildifre burn areas?

## Description

This is a project launched during the [Wolfram Summer School](https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school) of 2021. We embarked on a project to assess how effective vector (e.g., roads and streams) and raster (e.g., vegetationa classes and topography) elements of the landscape constrain wildfire spread. We found that roads are more effective than streams at stoping wildfire spread using [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). The current thrust of the project is to train a classifier able to predict if a given region is likely to burn.
